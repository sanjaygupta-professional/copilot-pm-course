# Stakeholder Interview Synthesis Template

## Basic Synthesis Prompt

```
Analyze these stakeholder interviews from Accenture employees. I'm looking
for patterns that will inform our AKX and ADH product priorities.

Please identify:
1. **Common Pain Points** - Issues mentioned by 2+ stakeholders (note their roles)
2. **Feature Requests** - Specific capabilities stakeholders asked for
3. **Competitive Comparisons** - Any mentions of McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte tools
4. **Adoption Barriers** - Why people don't use AKX/ADH
5. **Quick Wins** - Things that seem easy to fix with high impact

For each finding, note:
- Which interviews mentioned it (by participant role)
- Business impact (revenue, efficiency, talent retention)
- Include a compelling quote

Group findings by persona type: Partners, Consultants, Delivery Managers, Others
```

## Role-Based Analysis

```
Analyze these interviews by enterprise role:

**Partners/Practice Leads:**
- What do they need to win deals?
- Expert discovery pain points
- Competitive intelligence gaps

**Senior Consultants:**
- Daily workflow friction
- Template and content reuse needs
- Comparison to BCG/McKinsey tools

**Delivery Managers:**
- Project visibility challenges
- Resource planning needs
- Reporting automation desires

**New Analysts:**
- Onboarding experience
- Learning curve with tools
- Support and guidance needs

For each role, provide:
1. Top 3 pain points (with quotes)
2. Feature requests (prioritized)
3. Adoption barriers specific to their role
```

## Steering Committee Summary

```
Create a steering committee summary from these stakeholder interviews:

Focus on:
1. **Key Insights** (top 5 findings for executive attention)
2. **Business Impact** (revenue/efficiency implications)
3. **Competitive Gaps** (vs. McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte)
4. **Recommended Actions** (prioritized by impact)
5. **Risks if Not Addressed** (talent, competitive, operational)

Format:
- Executive summary (3 sentences)
- Key findings table (finding | frequency | impact | recommendation)
- Supporting quotes for each major finding
- Recommended next steps

This will be presented to the CKO and steering committee.
```

## Pattern Identification

```
Analyze these interviews for patterns:

1. **Frequency Analysis**
   - Which issues were mentioned most often?
   - Rank by number of unique mentions

2. **Severity Analysis**
   - Which issues had strongest emotional language?
   - What were described as "deal breakers"?

3. **Role Correlation**
   - Do Partners and Consultants have different priorities?
   - Are there conflicts between stakeholder needs?

4. **Competitive Benchmark**
   - What do users say about competitor tools?
   - What features do they wish we had from BCG/McKinsey?

5. **Quick Wins vs. Strategic**
   - What could we fix quickly?
   - What requires longer-term investment?

Create a prioritized action list for the product team.
```

## Quote Extraction

```
Extract the most compelling quotes from these interviews for:

1. **Pain Points** - Quotes showing user frustration
2. **Competitive Gaps** - Quotes comparing to McKinsey/BCG
3. **Feature Requests** - Quotes describing desired capabilities
4. **Success Stories** - Quotes about what's working well
5. **Adoption Barriers** - Quotes explaining why people don't use tools

For each quote:
- Participant role (e.g., "Partner, Financial Services Practice")
- Context (what prompted this comment)
- Potential use (steering committee, business case, training materials)

Format quotes for easy copy/paste into presentations.
```

## Batch Processing (Multiple Interviews)

```
I have [X] stakeholder interviews to analyze. Help me process them efficiently:

Batch 1 (first 5 interviews):
[Paste summaries or key points]

Create:
1. Consolidated pain point list (deduplicated, with frequency count)
2. Feature request inventory (by role)
3. Competitive comparison matrix
4. Quote bank (organized by theme)

After processing all batches, merge into a single synthesis report.
```
