## Building an Enterprise Visual Library

### Creating Consistency for Enterprise

For consistent visuals across your enterprise work:

1. **Follow brand guidelines** - Use approved corporate colors
2. **Keep it professional** - Internal ≠ informal
3. **Design for executives** - Clean, minimal, clear
4. **Save prompts** - Keep successful prompts for reuse

### Prompt Template Library for Enterprise

**For Stakeholder Personas:**
```
Create a professional illustration of [NAME]:
- [Gender], [age range], [ethnicity if relevant]
- [Role at consulting firm], [years experience]
- [Key personality traits relevant to role]
- [Attire description appropriate to seniority]
- [Background setting matching their work context]
- Illustration style: corporate, professional
- Expression: [appropriate to their persona]
```

**For Enterprise Flow Diagrams:**
```
Create a [type] diagram showing [process]:
[Steps numbered and connected with decision points]
Style: Clean, professional, governance-appropriate
Shapes: Rounded rectangles, diamonds for decisions
Colors: Corporate blue, professional palette
Layout: [horizontal/vertical] flow
Include: Relevant icons for each step
Professional enough for steering committee presentation
```

**For Internal Communications:**
```
Create an internal [announcement/training/campaign] graphic:
Visual elements: [list specific elements]
Text to include: [headlines/taglines]
Style: Professional internal communications
Colors: Corporate palette, not external marketing
Mood: [encouraging/informative/celebratory]
Purpose: [change management/training/awareness]
```

### Workflow: Copilot → Designer → Delivery

1. Generate base image in Copilot
2. Download the image
3. Open in Designer
4. Add corporate text, logos, enhancements
5. Export in needed format/size
6. Get brand/communications approval if needed

## Credit-Efficient Workflow for Enterprise

With limited credits, be strategic:

### Before Generating

1. Write your prompt fully with enterprise context
2. Specify "professional/corporate/executive-ready"
3. Reference successful past enterprise prompts
4. Be specific about colors matching brand guidelines

### Batch Similar Work

Generate all personas in one session:
- Similar prompts iterate better
- Consistent style across stakeholder images
- Efficient use of your time

### Reuse Across Enterprise

- Save all generated images to shared drive
- Many visuals work across presentations
- Minor edits in Designer vs. regenerating
- Build a shared enterprise visual library
