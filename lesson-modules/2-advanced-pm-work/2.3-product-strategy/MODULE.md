**Duration:** 35 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Modules 2.1-2.2 completed

---

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you will:
1. Apply strategic frameworks to enterprise internal products
2. Align product strategy with corporate priorities and governance
3. Develop portfolio-level thinking for internal tools
4. Navigate steering committee strategy discussions
5. Communicate strategy to diverse enterprise stakeholders

## Enterprise Strategy is Different

Enterprise internal product strategy differs fundamentally from external product strategy:

| External Product Strategy | Enterprise Internal Strategy |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Product-market fit | Organizational alignment |
| Customer acquisition | Adoption and change management |
| Revenue growth | Productivity and efficiency |
| Competitive differentiation | Internal tool portfolio fit |
| Series A/B/C milestones | Governance approval gates |
| Board presentation | Steering committee alignment |

Your job isn't to find product-market fit - it's to align with organizational priorities, drive adoption, and demonstrate business value.

## Strategic Frameworks for Enterprise

### Framework 1: Strategic Alignment Analysis

Before any initiative, ensure alignment with corporate priorities.

```
Analyze strategic alignment for AKX AI-Powered Search.

Accenture Corporate Priorities (Current Year):
1. GenAI Leadership - Be #1 in AI services
2. Talent Retention - Reduce attrition from 16% to 12%
3. Operational Efficiency - 5% productivity improvement
4. Competitive Positioning - Win vs. McKinsey, BCG

For AI-Powered Search, analyze:

1. **Direct Alignment**
   - Which corporate priorities does this directly support?
   - How strong is the connection? (Direct/Indirect/Weak)
   - What evidence would demonstrate alignment?

2. **Executive Narrative**
   - How would the CEO describe this investment?
   - What story does this tell about Accenture?

3. **Portfolio Fit**
   - How does this complement other internal investments?
   - Dependencies or conflicts with other initiatives?

4. **Risk to Priorities**
   - What happens if we DON'T invest?
   - Competitive risk? Talent risk?

5. **Steering Committee Positioning**
   - Key talking points for CKO sponsor
   - Anticipated concerns from other executives
   - How to frame for maximum support

Format for a steering committee strategy discussion.
```

### Framework 2: Enterprise SWOT Analysis

```
Create a SWOT analysis for AKX's position as Accenture's
knowledge management platform.

Context:
- 700,000+ employees globally
- 43% weekly active users (target: 60%)
- Competing with tools employees used at McKinsey, BCG
- $10M annual investment in platform
- CKO executive sponsor (Richard Thorne)

For each quadrant (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats):
- List 4-5 specific items relevant to enterprise context
- Note internal vs. external factors
- Consider governance, change management, talent implications

Then provide:
1. Strategic implications for each quadrant
2. Key strategic questions for steering committee
3. Recommended strategic priorities (top 3)
```

### Framework 3: Internal Tool Value Chain

```
Apply value chain analysis to AKX.

Value Chain Stages:
1. Content Creation → 2. Content Curation → 3. Search & Discovery
→ 4. Expert Connection → 5. Knowledge Application

For each stage:
- Current capability assessment (1-5)
- User pain points
- Competitive comparison (vs. what consultants used elsewhere)
- Investment opportunity

Identify:
- Where in the value chain do we differentiate?
- Where are we weakest?
- Where should we invest next?
- What's the strategic narrative for steering committee?
```

## Portfolio Strategy for Internal Tools

### Your Portfolio View

As Senior Product Owner for AKX and ADH, think portfolio-level:

```
Analyze the relationship between AKX and ADH as a portfolio.

AKX (Accenture Knowledge Exchange):
- Knowledge management platform
- 43% WAU, 700K users
- AI Search investment underway
- CKO sponsor

ADH (Accenture Delivery Hub):
- Project delivery and resource management
- 67% utilization visibility
- Integration with AKX planned
- CPO sponsor

Questions:
1. **Synergies**
   - How do these products work together?
   - What integrations would multiply value?
   - Example: ADH knows project needs, AKX finds experts

2. **Resource Allocation**
   - How should investment be split?
   - Which product has more ROI potential now?
   - Sequencing: Which investments unlock others?

3. **Stakeholder Management**
   - Two sponsors - how to coordinate?
   - Cross-functional dependencies
   - Unified vs. separate steering committees?

4. **Portfolio Story**
   - Combined narrative for leadership
   - "Knowledge to Delivery" value proposition
   - How this differentiates Accenture

Provide portfolio strategy recommendations for steering committee.
```

### Enterprise Roadmap Prioritization

Unlike startups optimizing for growth, enterprise prioritization considers:

```
Help me prioritize the AKX roadmap for next fiscal year.

Potential Initiatives:
1. AI-Powered Search (already approved, in progress)
2. Automated Expert Matching
3. Content Quality Scoring
4. Mobile Experience Redesign
5. Practice-Specific Dashboards
6. Integration with ADH (resource data)
7. GenAI Content Summarization
8. Gamification for Content Contribution

For each initiative, score:

**Enterprise Criteria:**
- Strategic Alignment (1-5): Corporate priority alignment
- Adoption Impact (1-5): Will this drive WAU?
- Sponsor Interest (1-5): Executive visibility/support
- Change Management Complexity (1-5): How hard to roll out?
- Integration Dependencies (1-5): Blocked by other work?
- Resource Availability (S/M/L/XL): Team capacity

**Business Value:**
- Productivity Gain: Time savings potential
- Competitive Response: Addresses McKinsey/BCG comparison
- Talent Impact: Helps retention/satisfaction

Create prioritized roadmap with:
1. "Now" (already committed)
2. "Next" (Q2 priorities)
3. "Later" (backlog for future)
4. "Not Now" (deprioritized with rationale)

Include steering committee presentation summary.
```

## Governance and Steering Committee Strategy

### Navigating Enterprise Governance

```
Help me prepare for the AKX steering committee strategy discussion.

Steering Committee Members:
- Richard Thorne (CKO) - Executive Sponsor
- Jennifer Walsh (VP Internal Digital Products) - My manager
- David Kim (MD Technology Practice) - Business Champion
- Sarah Mitchell (MD Strategy Practice) - Business Champion
- Maya Chen (CFO representative) - Budget authority
- Tom Bradley (CISO representative) - Risk/security

Each member cares about different things. Help me prepare:

1. **For Richard (CKO Sponsor)**
   - What CEO-level narrative does he need?
   - How does this support knowledge strategy?
   - What can he take to the executive committee?

2. **For David & Sarah (MDs)**
   - How does this help their practices win?
   - ROI specific to their teams
   - Success stories they can share

3. **For Maya (CFO rep)**
   - Investment justification
   - ROI and payback period
   - Budget efficiency

4. **For Tom (CISO rep)**
   - AI safety considerations
   - Data privacy controls
   - Risk mitigation

5. **Anticipated Conflicts**
   - Where might members disagree?
   - How to navigate competing priorities?
   - What compromises might be needed?

Create a "read-ahead" document and talking points for each stakeholder.
```

### Strategy Approval Process

```
Map the approval process for a major AKX initiative ($2M+).

I need to understand:

1. **Approval Gates**
   - What bodies need to approve?
   - In what sequence?
   - What documentation is required at each stage?

2. **Timeline**
   - Typical duration from proposal to approval?
   - When are key decision meetings?
   - What can we do in parallel vs. sequential?

3. **Stakeholder Influence**
   - Who has formal approval authority?
   - Who has informal influence?
   - Who could block this and why?

4. **Risk Mitigation**
   - What concerns typically arise?
   - How to pre-address common objections?
   - Who should we align with before formal meetings?

5. **Success Factors**
   - What makes proposals succeed?
   - What common mistakes kill initiatives?
   - Examples of well-positioned proposals?

Create an approval strategy timeline with key milestones.
```

## Competitive Strategy for Internal Tools

Your competition isn't external products - it's the status quo, workarounds, and tools employees used elsewhere.

### Using Researcher for Competitive Intel

```
[Use Researcher Agent]

Research knowledge management approaches at major consulting firms.

I need competitive intelligence on:
1. McKinsey Knowledge Center
2. BCG internal knowledge platform
3. Deloitte's knowledge management approach
4. Bain's internal tools

For each competitor:
- Platform name and capabilities
- AI/GenAI investments
- Reported adoption rates (if available)
- What employees who've worked there say
- Unique differentiators

Also research:
- Industry best practices for enterprise KM at scale
- Common challenges at 100K+ employee organizations
- What makes knowledge platforms succeed or fail

Create a competitive intelligence brief for steering committee.
Include recommendations for where Accenture should focus.
```

### Competitive Positioning for Internal Tools

```
Help me develop competitive positioning for AKX.

Our internal competition:
- Status quo: "I'll just ask my network"
- Workarounds: "I use Google/ChatGPT instead"
- Legacy tools: "I keep my own folder of templates"
- Memory of better tools: "At McKinsey, we had..."

For each competitor:
1. Why do people use it instead of AKX?
2. What would make them switch?
3. How do we address their objections?

Also develop:
- **Value Proposition**: Why AKX over alternatives?
- **Key Messages**: For Partners vs. Consultants vs. New Hires
- **Success Stories**: Proof points that overcome skepticism
- **Champion Playbook**: How supporters can advocate for AKX

Format for change management communications.
```

---

## Multi-Stakeholder Strategy Communication

### Executive Summary for Steering Committee

```
Transform my AKX strategy into a steering committee executive summary.

[Paste your strategy work]

Create a 1-page executive summary with:

1. **Strategic Context** (2-3 sentences)
   - Why this matters now
   - Alignment with corporate priorities

2. **Strategy Statement** (1 sentence)
   - Clear, memorable, 10 words or less

3. **Key Strategic Bets** (3 bullets)
   - Major investments/initiatives
   - Expected outcomes

4. **Success Metrics** (3-4 KPIs)
   - What we'll measure
   - Targets and timeline

5. **Investment Required** (specific ask)
   - Budget, headcount, timeline
   - What we get for the investment

6. **Risk & Mitigation** (top 2)
   - Biggest risks
   - How we'll address them

7. **Decision Needed**
   - Specific approval being requested
   - Timeline for decision

Tone: Confident, data-driven, business-focused.
Format for 5-minute steering committee review.
```

### Strategy for Different Audiences

```
I need to communicate AKX strategy to four different audiences.
Help me tailor the message for each.

CORE STRATEGY:
We're investing in AI-powered search to make AKX the fastest way to find
knowledge and experts at Accenture, driving adoption from 43% to 60% WAU
and generating $50M in annual productivity value.

Create versions for:

1. **Steering Committee** (executives)
   - Focus: Strategic alignment, ROI, governance
   - Length: 5-minute verbal summary
   - Tone: Confident, business-focused

2. **Managing Directors** (practice leaders)
   - Focus: How this helps their practice win
   - Length: 2-paragraph email
   - Tone: Collaborative, results-oriented

3. **Consultants** (daily users)
   - Focus: How this helps their daily work
   - Length: Slack message
   - Tone: Practical, peer-to-peer

4. **Change Management Team** (rollout partners)
   - Focus: Adoption approach, training needs
   - Length: Strategy brief
   - Tone: Detailed, actionable

For each version, include the key message and call to action.
```

## Devil's Advocate Analysis

Ask Copilot to stress-test your strategy:

```
Play devil's advocate on this AKX strategy:

STRATEGY SUMMARY:
Invest $2M in AI-powered search to improve AKX adoption from 43% to 60%
WAU, generating $50M+ in annual productivity value through time savings.

As a skeptical steering committee member, challenge:

1. **Assumption Testing**
   - What assumptions are we making about adoption?
   - What if users still prefer their workarounds?
   - Are our time savings estimates realistic?

2. **Competitive Reality**
   - Why haven't we solved this already?
   - What makes us think AI search will work?
   - What if McKinsey is investing 10x more?

3. **Execution Risk**
   - 700K users is massive scale - can we really change behavior?
   - What if the technology doesn't work as promised?
   - Change management capacity concerns?

4. **Alternative Investments**
   - Why this vs. other priorities?
   - What's the opportunity cost?
   - Could this money have more impact elsewhere?

5. **Pre-Mortem**
   - It's 18 months from now and this failed. Why?
   - What went wrong?
   - What should we have done differently?

Be tough but constructive. I need to stress-test before steering committee.
```

## Exercise: Strategic Planning Session

Let's run through a complete strategic planning exercise.

### Step 1: Situation Analysis

```
Create a strategic situation analysis for AKX.

Consider:
1. Internal environment (adoption, satisfaction, capabilities)
2. External environment (competitors, industry trends)
3. Stakeholder landscape (sponsors, champions, users)
4. Resource constraints (budget, team, capacity)
5. Governance context (approval requirements, timeline pressures)

Format as a "Strategic Context" brief for steering committee.
```

### Step 2: Strategic Options

```
Generate 3 strategic options for AKX's next fiscal year:

**Option A: AI-First Transformation**
- Aggressive AI investment
- High risk, high reward
- Requires significant budget increase

**Option B: Adoption Acceleration**
- Focus on driving usage of existing capabilities
- Lower investment, change management focus
- Incremental improvement

**Option C: Platform Integration**
- Connect AKX with ADH and other tools
- Medium investment
- Network effects strategy

For each option:
- Key initiatives
- Investment required
- Expected outcomes (WAU, ROI, satisfaction)
- Risks and dependencies
- Steering committee reception (likely support/concern)

Recommend an option with supporting rationale.
```

### Step 3: Stakeholder Alignment

```
Create a stakeholder alignment plan for the recommended strategy.

For each key stakeholder:
- Their likely reaction
- Their key concerns
- How to address concerns
- What they need to champion this
- When/how to engage them

Map the path to steering committee approval.
```
