# Module 2.1: Writing PRDs with Copilot (Enterprise Edition)

**Duration:** 35 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Level 1 completed

---

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you will:
1. Use Copilot as a thinking partner (not ghostwriter) for enterprise PRDs
2. Include business cases with ROI calculations
3. Add governance sections (steering committee, stakeholders, RACI)
4. Create change management considerations
5. Get multi-perspective feedback from enterprise stakeholders

---

## Enterprise PRDs Are Different

Internal enterprise PRDs require elements that external product PRDs don't:

| Standard PRD | Enterprise Internal PRD |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Problem statement | Problem + Business case |
| User stories | Stakeholder analysis |
| Success metrics | Adoption metrics + ROI |
| Technical requirements | Integration requirements |
| Risks | Governance & change management |
| Launch plan | Change management & communications |

### Key Additions for Enterprise PRDs

1. **Business Case with ROI** - Justify the investment
2. **Stakeholder Analysis** - Who needs to approve, champion, or be informed
3. **Governance** - Decision rights, steering committee alignment
4. **Change Management** - How will 700,000 users adopt this?
5. **RACI Matrix** - Clear accountability

---

## The Right Mindset: Thinking Partner, Not Ghostwriter

**Important:** Copilot should help you think through your PRD, not write it for you.

### The Right Approach

| Don't Do This | Do This Instead |
|---------------|-----------------|
| "Write a PRD for feature X" | "Help me build the business case for feature X" |
| "Create requirements for me" | "What governance considerations should I address?" |
| "Generate the full document" | "Let's structure the stakeholder analysis section" |

## The Enterprise PRD Workflow

### Phase 1: Business Context
- Define the business problem and opportunity
- Build ROI case
- Identify stakeholders and governance

### Phase 2: Solution & Impact
- Explore solution options
- Define success metrics
- Plan change management

### Phase 3: Document & Governance
- Structure the PRD with enterprise sections
- Create RACI matrix
- Prepare for steering committee

### Phase 4: Review & Alignment
- Multi-perspective stakeholder review
- Address governance concerns
- Prepare for approval

---

## Phase 1: Business Context

### Step 1: Define Business Problem

Use this prompt to clarify the business context:

```
I'm writing an enterprise PRD for AKX's AI-powered search feature.

Here's what I know:
- Current AKX weekly active users: 43% (target: 60%)
- Average search time: 8 minutes (target: 2 minutes)
- Search satisfaction: 3.2/5 (target: 4.0/5)
- Competitors (McKinsey, BCG) have better knowledge platforms
- Lost $20M deal because we couldn't identify an expert in 48 hours

Help me articulate:
1. The business problem (not just user problem)
2. Competitive implications
3. Financial impact of NOT solving this
4. How this aligns with company strategic priorities

Ask me clarifying questions if needed.
```

### Step 2: Build the Business Case

This is critical for enterprise PRDs - you need to justify the investment.

```
Help me build a business case for AI-powered search in AKX.

Investment context:
- Development cost: ~$2M over 6 months
- Ongoing cost: ~$500K/year

Potential benefits:
- Time saved per consultant: 4+ hours/week
- 300,000 potential weekly users
- Average consultant billing rate: $300/hour
- Faster expert discovery → more deals won
- Reduced duplicate work → higher efficiency

Please create:

1. **ROI Calculation**
   - Quantified time savings
   - Productivity gain value
   - Conservative, moderate, and optimistic scenarios

2. **Strategic Value**
   - Competitive positioning benefits
   - Talent retention impact
   - Revenue enablement potential

3. **Risk-Adjusted Analysis**
   - What could reduce ROI?
   - What assumptions are we making?

Format this for a steering committee business case presentation.
```

### Step 3: Stakeholder Analysis

```
Help me identify stakeholders for the AKX AI Search initiative.

Known stakeholders:
- Richard Thorne (CKO) - Executive Sponsor
- Jennifer Walsh (VP Internal Digital Products) - Product Lead
- David Kim (MD Technology Practice) - Business Champion
- Sarah Mitchell (MD Strategy Practice) - Business Champion

For a comprehensive stakeholder analysis, help me identify:

1. **Decision Makers** - Who has approval authority?
2. **Champions** - Who will actively promote this?
3. **Influencers** - Who shapes opinions?
4. **Users** - Who will use this daily?
5. **Impacted Parties** - Who is affected even if not direct users?

For each stakeholder group:
- Their key interests/concerns
- How to engage them
- Risk if not aligned

Format as a stakeholder map with engagement strategy.
```

---

## Phase 2: Solution & Impact

### Generate Strategic Approaches

```
Let's develop 3 distinct approaches for AI-powered search in AKX:

**Approach A: AI Search Only**
(Semantic search with quality ranking)

**Approach B: AI Search + Expert Matching**
(Search plus automated expert recommendations)

**Approach C: Full AI Knowledge Assistant**
(Search + experts + personalized recommendations + content generation)

For each approach, outline:
1. Scope and features
2. Investment required
3. Time to deliver
4. Adoption complexity
5. ROI potential
6. Risk profile
7. Steering committee appeal

Include recommendation for which approach to pursue.
```

### Define Success Metrics (Enterprise)

```
Help me define success metrics for AI Search that will satisfy:

1. **Executive Sponsors** (Richard, CKO)
   - Strategic metrics they'll report to the board
   - Competitive positioning indicators

2. **Business Champions** (David, Sarah - MDs)
   - Practice-level impact metrics
   - Revenue enablement indicators

3. **Users** (Partners, Consultants)
   - Daily experience metrics
   - Time savings indicators

4. **Product Team** (Jennifer, me)
   - Leading indicators for product health
   - Adoption and engagement metrics

Create a metrics framework with:
- Metric name and definition
- Target value
- How we'll measure
- Who cares most about this metric
- Reporting frequency
```

### Plan Change Management

```
AI Search is a major change for 700,000 users. Help me think through
change management requirements.

Questions to address:

1. **Awareness**
   - How will users know this exists?
   - What channels reach different personas?

2. **Desire**
   - Users have tried AKX before and given up
   - How do we rebuild trust?

3. **Knowledge**
   - What training is needed?
   - How do we reach 700K users?

4. **Ability**
   - Is the product intuitive enough?
   - What support will be needed?

5. **Reinforcement**
   - How do we keep users engaged?
   - What ongoing communications are needed?

Create a change management summary for the PRD.
```
