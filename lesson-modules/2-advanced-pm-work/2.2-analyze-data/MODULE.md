## Why Enterprise PMs Need Data Analysis

Enterprise internal product decisions require strong data support:

| Decision Type | Data Needed |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Investment justification** | ROI calculations, productivity gains |
| **Steering committee updates** | Adoption trends, utilization metrics |
| **Change management** | Adoption funnel analysis, barrier identification |
| **Portfolio prioritization** | Comparative feature impact, resource efficiency |
| **Business case validation** | Pilot results, projected benefits |

Copilot makes enterprise data analysis accessible without needing SQL or Python.

## Enterprise Metrics That Matter

Unlike external products focused on revenue and growth, enterprise internal tools track:

### Adoption Metrics
- **Weekly Active Users (WAU)** - Consistent platform usage
- **Provisioned vs. Active** - How many with access actually use it
- **Feature Adoption** - Which capabilities are being used
- **Adoption by Role** - Partners vs. Consultants vs. Delivery Managers

### Utilization Metrics
- **Search Success Rate** - Finding what you need
- **Time to Find Expert** - Expert discovery efficiency
- **Content Quality Scores** - Relevance and freshness
- **Workflow Completion** - End-to-end task completion

### Business Impact Metrics
- **Time Savings** - Hours saved per user per week
- **Deals Won** - Impact on competitive wins
- **Productivity Gain** - Billable hour efficiency
- **Talent Retention** - Employee satisfaction correlation

## Method 1: Adoption Funnel Analysis

### Exercise 1: Analyze AKX Adoption Funnel

Let's analyze AKX's adoption funnel - a critical metric for internal tools.

**Sample Data (or use `sample-files/data/adoption-funnel.csv`):**

```
Week,Provisioned_Users,Logged_In,Searched,Found_Useful,Returned_Next_Week,WAU_Rate
Week 1,680000,340000,238000,166600,119952,17.6%
Week 2,682000,347000,250000,175000,131250,19.2%
Week 3,685000,356000,263000,189360,142020,20.7%
Week 4,687000,370000,281000,210750,163000,23.7%
...
Week 24,700000,448000,358000,286000,294000,42.0%
```

**Do this now:**

1. Upload the adoption funnel data to Copilot
2. Use this prompt:

```
Analyze this AKX (Accenture Knowledge Exchange) adoption funnel data.

Context: AKX is an internal knowledge management platform for 700,000 Accenture employees.
Our target is 60% WAU. Current state shown in data.

Please provide:

1. **Funnel Health Assessment**
   - Current conversion rates at each stage
   - Where are the biggest drop-offs?
   - What's the overall provisioned-to-WAU rate?

2. **Trend Analysis**
   - Is adoption improving over time?
   - What's the weekly growth rate?
   - Project when we'll hit 60% WAU at current trajectory

3. **Bottleneck Identification**
   - Which funnel stage has the biggest opportunity?
   - If we improve "Found Useful" from 70% to 80%, what's the impact on WAU?
   - Quantify the opportunity for each stage

4. **Segment Analysis**
   - Any patterns in the data suggesting user segment differences?
   - What would you want to slice by (role, practice, geography)?

5. **Steering Committee Summary**
   - 3-sentence summary for executive sponsors
   - Key metric trend to highlight
   - Primary recommendation

Format as a report suitable for a steering committee update.
```

## Exercise 2: Utilization Data Analysis

Internal tools also need to track productivity impact.

**Sample Data (or use `sample-files/data/utilization-data.csv`):**

```
Practice,Consultants,AKX_Active_Users,Avg_Searches_Week,Avg_Search_Time_Min,Expert_Connections,Utilization_Rate
Technology,85000,38250,12.5,2.8,1250,92%
Strategy,35000,14000,8.2,3.4,890,89%
Operations,45000,15750,6.1,4.2,450,87%
Financial Services,55000,23100,10.8,2.1,980,91%
Health & Public Service,40000,14000,7.5,3.8,560,88%
```

**Do this now:**

Use this prompt:

```
Analyze this AKX utilization data by practice at Accenture.

Please provide:

1. **Practice Comparison**
   - Which practices have highest/lowest AKX adoption?
   - Correlation between AKX usage and practice utilization rate?
   - Are high-utilization practices using AKX more?

2. **Search Efficiency Analysis**
   - Which practices have most efficient search (lowest time)?
   - What might explain the differences?
   - Benchmark: Target is 2 minutes average. Who's meeting it?

3. **Expert Connection Analysis**
   - Expert connections per active user by practice
   - Which practices are getting most value from expert discovery?

4. **ROI Estimation**
   - If Technology practice saves 5 min/search vs. old system (8 min)
   - Calculate weekly time savings across all 38,250 active users
   - At $300/hour billing rate, what's the annual value?

5. **Recommendations**
   - Which practices need adoption support?
   - What best practices from Technology should be shared?
   - Priority actions for Change Management team
```

and Utilization_Rate by practice
```

```
Create a pivot table summarizing total time savings by practice,
sorted from highest to lowest
```
