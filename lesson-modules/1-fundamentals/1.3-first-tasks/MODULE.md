Let's tackle each one with Copilot!

---

## Task 1: Steering Committee Notes → Action Items

**Time without Copilot:** 45 minutes
**Time with Copilot:** 3 minutes

### The Problem

You have raw notes from multiple meetings including a steering committee. You need:
- Clear action items with owners and deadlines
- Key decisions documented for the record
- Risks and escalations flagged
- Executive summary for your sponsor

### Step-by-Step

1. **Upload the meeting notes file**
   - Use the 📎 button or drag and drop
   - Upload: `meeting-notes-raw.md` from the sample files

2. **Use this prompt:**

```
Please analyze these meeting notes from Accenture's Internal Digital Products team
and create a structured summary suitable for enterprise governance:

## Executive Summary
- 3-4 sentences summarizing the key outcomes

## Action Items
- List each action item
- Assign owner (based on context)
- Note deadline if mentioned
- Flag priority (Critical/High/Medium)

## Decisions Made
- List any decisions finalized in these meetings
- Note who made/approved the decision

## Risks & Escalations
- Any issues that need to be escalated to sponsors
- Competitive threats mentioned

## Open Questions
- Items needing follow-up or sponsor input

## Next Steps
- What happens next? When is the next checkpoint?

Format as clean markdown suitable for a steering committee update.
```

3. **Review and refine**
   - Copilot extracts the structure
   - You verify owners and deadlines
   - Copy to your status deck or SharePoint

### Try It Now!

Use this sample steering committee notes content if you don't have the file:

```
AKX steering committee 2/13
richard (CKO sponsor) concerned about WAU - stuck at 43%
david kim (MD tech practice) says search is terrible
"my team searches for SAP expertise, gets 500 results, most from 2019"
sarah mitchell mentioned we lost a deal to BCG - they identified experts in 48 hrs, we took 4 days
decision: AI search is #1 priority, mobile can slip if needed
jennifer to assess if we can accelerate Q2 to Q1 end
TODO: me - draft proposal for auto skill profiles from ADH
david will identify 3 practice leads for pilot
richard presenting to CEO next month, needs to show progress
change mgmt meeting later - need adoption campaign for AI search launch
technical review with raj and amit on ADH integration
```

---

## Task 2: Synthesize Stakeholder Interviews

**Time without Copilot:** 3-4 hours
**Time with Copilot:** 5 minutes

### The Problem

You have 8 stakeholder interview transcripts from across Accenture:
- Partners and Practice Leads (Priya's persona)
- Senior Consultants (Marcus's persona)
- Delivery Managers (Elena's persona)
- New Analysts, Project Managers, Knowledge Managers, Operations Leads, Executives

You need to find patterns across roles and prioritize insights by business impact.

### Step-by-Step

**Important:** Copilot can analyze up to 5 files at once. For 8 files, do this:

1. **Batch 1: Upload first 5 interviews**
   - Upload files together
   - Use this prompt:

```
Analyze these 5 stakeholder interviews from Accenture employees. I'm looking
for patterns that will inform our AKX and ADH product priorities.

Please identify:
1. **Common Pain Points** - Issues mentioned by 2+ stakeholders (note their roles)
2. **Feature Requests** - Specific capabilities stakeholders asked for
3. **Competitive Comparisons** - Any mentions of McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte tools
4. **Adoption Barriers** - Why people don't use AKX/ADH
5. **Quick Wins** - Things that seem easy to fix with high impact

For each finding, note:
- Which interviews mentioned it (by participant role)
- Business impact (revenue, efficiency, talent retention)
- Include a compelling quote

Group findings by persona type: Partners, Consultants, Delivery Managers, Others
```

2. **Batch 2: Upload remaining 3 interviews**
   - Ask Copilot to analyze these using the same format

3. **Combine findings**
   - Ask Copilot to merge the two analyses:

```
Here are findings from two batches of stakeholder interviews at Accenture.
Please merge into a single, prioritized synthesis.

Rank pain points by:
1. Business impact (revenue/efficiency)
2. Frequency (how many mentioned it)
3. Feasibility (how hard to fix)

Create a "Key Insights for Steering Committee" section with the top 5 findings.
```

### Alternative: Use Researcher Agent

For complex synthesis, try the Researcher agent:

1. Upload all files first
2. Click on "Researcher" in the left panel
3. Ask: "Analyze these stakeholder interviews and create a comprehensive research synthesis report for our steering committee"

Researcher takes longer (5-10 min) but produces more thorough analysis.

## Task 3: Communication Transformation

**Time without Copilot:** 60 minutes
**Time with Copilot:** 5 minutes

### The Problem

You have ONE update about AI search launching. You need to communicate it to:
- **Partners (Priya)** - High-level business impact, time savings
- **Consultants (Marcus)** - How it helps their daily work
- **Executive Sponsors (Richard)** - Metrics, competitive positioning, ROI

### Step-by-Step

1. **Start with your core message:**

```
I need to communicate this product update to three different audiences at Accenture.

THE UPDATE:
We're launching AI-powered search for AKX next month. In beta testing with
the Technology practice (500 users), average search time dropped from 8 minutes
to 2 minutes. Search satisfaction improved from 3.2/5 to 4.1/5. Expert discovery
improved - users found relevant experts in 15 minutes vs. 2+ days previously.

Please create three versions:

1. **PARTNER COMMUNICATION** (for Practice Leads like Priya)
   - Focus on business impact (winning deals, finding experts)
   - Lead with time savings and competitive advantage
   - 2 short paragraphs, professional but not formal
   - End with "how to get involved in pilot"

2. **CONSULTANT EMAIL** (for consultants like Marcus)
   - Focus on how it helps their daily work
   - Emphasize: find templates faster, stop recreating work
   - Casual, peer-to-peer tone
   - Include 2-3 specific use cases
   - 3-4 short paragraphs

3. **EXECUTIVE BRIEFING** (for steering committee sponsors like Richard)
   - Lead with metrics and competitive positioning
   - Include: adoption targets, ROI, timeline, risks
   - Reference competitive pressure (McKinsey, BCG)
   - Structured with headers
   - Include "asks" for executive support
```

2. **Review each version**
   - Copilot adapts tone, detail level, and focus
   - Each version serves its audience perfectly

### The Power of Style Templates

For recurring communication needs, we've included templates in the `communication-styles/` folder:

- `style-slack-update.md` - Template for Teams/Slack messages
- `style-executive-email.md` - Template for exec communications
- `style-notion-doc.md` - Template for wiki documentation

**Pro tip:** Upload a style template and ask Copilot to "Write in this style."

---

## Task 4: Design Mockup Feedback

**Time without Copilot:** 20 minutes
**Time with Copilot:** 3 minutes

### The Problem

Design sent you a mockup for the new AI search interface in AKX. You need to provide structured PM feedback covering usability, alignment with personas, and enterprise considerations.

### Step-by-Step

1. **Upload the design image**
   - Drag & drop the mockup image
   - Or use 📎 to attach

2. **Use this prompt:**

```
Analyze this design mockup from a Product Manager perspective.

Context: This is for AKX (Accenture Knowledge Exchange), an internal knowledge
management platform for 700,000+ Accenture employees.

Our users are:
- Priya (Partner) - uses mobile between meetings, needs results in 5 minutes
- Marcus (Consultant) - power user, needs quality filtering, compares to BCG tools
- Elena (Delivery Manager) - occasional user, needs project templates

Please provide feedback on:

1. **Usability** - Is it intuitive? Any confusion points?
2. **Persona Fit** - How well does it serve each user type?
3. **Information Hierarchy** - Is the most important info prominent?
4. **Enterprise Considerations** - Accessibility, data privacy, scale
5. **Mobile Readiness** - Will this work on Partner's phones?
6. **Competitive Comparison** - How does this compare to what we know about McKinsey/BCG?
7. **Questions for Design** - What should I ask the designer?

Be constructive and specific. Reference our personas by name.
```

3. **Copilot analyzes the visual**
   - It can read text in images
   - It understands UI patterns
   - It provides structured feedback

### Sample Mockup Exercise

If you don't have a mockup, describe one to Copilot:

```
Imagine an AKX search interface mockup with:
- Top search bar with "AI-powered" badge
- Filter panel on left (industry, capability, content type, date)
- Main results area showing document cards
- Each card shows: title, preview snippet, author, date, quality score (1-5 stars)
- Right sidebar showing "Related Experts" with profile photos
- Mobile responsive design

Analyze this from a PM perspective for AKX serving our three personas.
```

## Task 5: Competitive Research - Consulting Firms

**Time without Copilot:** 90 minutes
**Time with Copilot:** 10 minutes

### The Problem

The steering committee wants to understand what competitors are doing with their knowledge management platforms. You need quick intelligence on McKinsey, BCG, and Deloitte.

### Option A: Quick Research (5 min)

Use regular Copilot Chat:

```
I'm a Product Owner at Accenture responsible for our internal knowledge
management platform (AKX). Our competitors are McKinsey, BCG, and Deloitte.

What do you know about their internal knowledge management and expert discovery
tools? Specifically:

1. McKinsey Knowledge Center - what makes it the "gold standard"?
2. BCG's AI investments in internal tools
3. Deloitte's knowledge platform modernization efforts

I need to understand:
- What capabilities they have that we might lack
- Their approach to content curation
- AI/GenAI investments
- What Accenture employees who came from these firms say about the tools

This is for a steering committee discussion.
```

Copilot uses its knowledge + web grounding to answer.

### Option B: Deep Research (10 min)

Use the **Researcher** agent for comprehensive analysis:

1. Click "Researcher" in the left panel
2. Enter this prompt:

```
Research knowledge management and expert discovery platforms at major consulting firms.
I need competitive intelligence for Accenture's internal tools team.

Firms to research: McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte, Bain, IBM Consulting

For each firm, find:
- Internal knowledge management platform name and capabilities
- AI/GenAI investments in internal tools
- Expert discovery and matching capabilities
- Any public information about adoption rates or effectiveness
- Recent news or announcements about internal tool improvements

Also research:
- Industry best practices for enterprise knowledge management
- Common challenges at consulting firm scale (50,000+ employees)
- How firms measure KM platform success

Create a competitive comparison report I can present to our steering committee.
Include recommendations for where Accenture should focus.
```

3. Researcher works for 5-10 minutes
4. Returns a comprehensive, cited report
