## Introduction

Welcome to the Microsoft Copilot PM Course!

You're about to learn how to use Microsoft Copilot - an AI assistant that can save you **10-20 hours per week** as a Product Manager. Unlike traditional tools, Copilot integrates directly into the Microsoft 365 apps you already use: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams.

Throughout this course, you'll work as a **Senior Product Owner** at **Accenture** - one of the world's largest consulting firms with 700,000+ employees globally. You'll own two internal products: **AKX** (Accenture Knowledge Exchange) and **ADH** (Accenture Delivery Hub).

**What makes this course different:** All the files, documents, and context are already created for you. You're stepping into a real (contextualized) PM role with active products, real user personas, and actual work to do!

| **Users** | Paying customers | Employees (no choice) |
| **Success metric** | Revenue, retention | Adoption, efficiency, NPS |
