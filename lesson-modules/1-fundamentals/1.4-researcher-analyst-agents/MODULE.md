## What Are Copilot Agents?

Agents are **specialized AI assistants** built into Microsoft 365 Copilot. They're designed for specific types of complex tasks.

### Regular Copilot Chat vs Agents

| Regular Copilot Chat | Agents |
|---------------------|--------|
| Quick Q&A | Multi-step reasoning |
| Single-turn tasks | Extended workflows |
| Immediate responses | Takes 5-10 minutes |
| General purpose | Specialized tasks |
| Uses GPT-5 | Uses reasoning models (o3) |

### Available Agents in M365 Copilot

1. **Researcher** - Deep research across web and work data
2. **Analyst** - Complex data analysis and reasoning
3. **Workflows** - Automation across M365 apps

**Note:** You get 25 combined Researcher + Analyst queries per month with M365 Copilot license.

## Accessing Agents

To access agents in Copilot:

1. Go to **copilot.microsoft.com**
2. Look at the **left panel**
3. You'll see agents listed (Researcher, Analyst, etc.)
4. Click an agent to start a specialized session

Alternatively, in the chat:
- Type **@Researcher** followed by your question
- Type **@Analyst** followed by your data analysis request

---

## The Researcher Agent

Researcher is your **AI research assistant**. It performs deep, multi-step research and produces comprehensive reports.

### What Researcher Does

1. Breaks your question into sub-questions
2. Searches across web AND your work data
3. Evaluates multiple sources
4. Synthesizes findings
5. Produces a cited report

### When to Use Researcher

| Use Researcher For | Don't Use For |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Competitive analysis (consulting firms) | Quick facts |
| Industry best practices | Simple questions |
| Multi-source synthesis | Single document analysis |
| Strategic reports for steering committees | Real-time data |
| Change management research | Basic summaries |

### Researcher Example: Competitive Intelligence

**Prompt:**

```
Research how major consulting firms (McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte) handle
internal knowledge management and expert discovery. I need to understand:

1. What platforms/tools do they use?
2. How do they approach content curation at scale?
3. What AI/GenAI investments have they made in internal tools?
4. What are their adoption rates (if publicly available)?
5. What best practices can Accenture learn from?

I'm a Product Owner at Accenture responsible for AKX (our internal
knowledge platform with 700,000+ users). Create a comprehensive
competitive intelligence report I can share with our steering committee.
```

**What happens:**
- Researcher shows its "thinking" as it works
- Takes 5-10 minutes
- Produces a multi-page report with citations
- You can export to Word

## Exercise 1: Use Researcher

Let's try a research task relevant to your Accenture PM role.

**Do this now:**

1. Click on **Researcher** in the left panel
2. Enter this prompt:

```
Research best practices for driving adoption of internal enterprise tools.
I'm a Product Owner at Accenture responsible for an internal knowledge
management platform. Our weekly active users are stuck at 43% (target: 60%).

I need:
1. Industry benchmarks for internal tool adoption at large enterprises
2. Top strategies companies use to drive adoption of internal platforms
3. Case studies of companies that significantly improved internal tool usage
4. Role of change management vs product improvements
5. Metrics we should track beyond WAU

Create a strategic report with actionable recommendations
for our steering committee.
```

3. Watch Researcher work (notice the "thinking" display)
4. Review the final report

**What to notice:**
- The depth of analysis
- Citations and sources
- Structured, actionable output
- Takes longer but more thorough

## The Analyst Agent

Analyst is your **AI data scientist**. It uses reasoning models to solve complex analytical problems.

### What Analyst Does

1. Understands your data analysis question
2. Applies multi-step reasoning
3. Performs calculations and analysis
4. Explains its methodology
5. Provides insights and recommendations

### When to Use Analyst

| Use Analyst For | Don't Use For |
|----------------|---------------|
| Complex adoption funnel analysis | Simple sums/averages |
| Statistical significance testing | Basic charts |
| Multi-variable problems | Quick calculations |
| Predictive insights | Real-time dashboards |
| ROI calculations for business cases | Data cleaning |

### Analyst Example: Adoption Cohort Analysis

**Prompt:**

```
I'm analyzing AKX adoption cohorts at Accenture. Here's the data:

September cohort (new hires):
- 5,000 provisioned users
- 3,400 logged in first week (68%)
- 2,200 performed a search (44%)
- 1,100 weekly active at 30 days (22%)

October cohort (new hires):
- 5,500 provisioned users
- 3,850 logged in first week (70%)
- 2,750 performed a search (50%)
- 1,430 weekly active at 30 days (26%)

November cohort (new hires):
- 4,800 provisioned users
- 3,600 logged in first week (75%)
- 2,880 performed a search (60%)
- 1,584 weekly active at 30 days (33%)

Analyze this data and help me understand:
1. What's the trend in activation and retention?
2. Is the improvement statistically significant?
3. Where's the biggest drop-off in the funnel?
4. What should we project for December if the trend continues?
5. What should I present to the steering committee?
```

**What Analyst provides:**
- Statistical analysis of trends
- Significance calculations
- Funnel analysis identifying bottlenecks
- Projections with confidence levels
- Clear explanation of methodology

Help me analyze this A/B test result for AKX AI Search:

Control group (old search):
- 5,000 users in pilot
- Average search time: 8.2 minutes
- Search success rate: 67%
- User satisfaction: 3.2/5
- Time to find expert: 55 hours average

Test group (AI-powered search):
- 5,000 users in pilot
- Average search time: 2.4 minutes
- Search success rate: 82%
- User satisfaction: 4.1/5
- Time to find expert: 12 hours average

Questions:
1. Are these results statistically significant?
2. What's the estimated time savings across 700,000 users?
3. What's the ROI if average consultant billing rate is $300/hour?
4. Should we roll out to 100% of users?
5. Write a recommendation for the steering committee with ROI justification.
```

3. Review Analyst's methodology and conclusions

**What to notice:**
- Step-by-step reasoning
- Statistical rigor
- ROI calculations
- Clear recommendations with business justification
- Explains the "why" behind conclusions

## The Workflows Agent

Workflows is your **automation assistant**. It helps you create automated flows across M365 apps.

### What Workflows Can Do

1. Send automated emails and reminders
2. Create calendar events based on triggers
3. Post updates to Teams channels
4. Manage SharePoint files
5. Connect to Planner and other M365 services

### Example Workflow: Steering Committee Prep

**Prompt:**

```
Create a workflow that:
1. Every Thursday at 2pm
2. Sends me an email reminder to update AKX metrics for steering committee
3. On Friday at 9am, reminds me to finalize the steering committee deck
4. Then on Monday at 8am (before the 9am meeting)
5. Posts a reminder to my team's Teams channel that steering committee is today
```

Workflows builds this automation without you needing to use Power Automate directly.

## When to Use Each Tool

Here's a decision framework for enterprise PM tasks:

```
Is it a quick question?
├── YES → Use regular Copilot Chat
└── NO → Does it require deep research?
    ├── YES → Use Researcher (5-10 min)
    │   Examples: Competitive intel, best practices, industry research
    └── NO → Does it require complex analysis?
        ├── YES → Use Analyst
        │   Examples: Adoption analysis, ROI calc, statistical tests
        └── NO → Does it need automation?
            ├── YES → Use Workflows
            │   Examples: Reminders, status updates, recurring tasks
            └── NO → Use regular Copilot Chat
```

### Quick Reference for Enterprise PMs
