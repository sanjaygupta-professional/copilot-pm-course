## Interview

**Q: What's your vision for AKX?**

Richard: "Simply put: any Accenture employee should be able to find any expert or any knowledge asset in under 5 minutes. Today it takes hours, sometimes days. We have 700,000 people creating incredible work, and most of it is invisible. We're paying the cost of reinvention every single day."

**Q: What does that cost look like?**

Richard: "We did a study. Conservative estimate: $200 million per year in duplicated effort. Consultants recreating proposals, analyses, frameworks that already exist. That's not even counting the opportunity cost - deals we lose because we can't mobilize expertise fast enough. The BCG deal Sarah Mitchell mentioned? That's $20 million we lost because we couldn't identify a blockchain expert in 48 hours."

**Q: Why hasn't AKX solved this already?**

Richard: "Underinvestment, honestly. We've spent years iterating on features without fixing the fundamental problem: search doesn't work. The platform is technically capable. We have the content. We have the experts. But if you can't find them, none of it matters. We've been polishing the edges while the core is broken."

**Q: What's your expectation for AI search?**

Richard: "It needs to be transformational. Not incremental improvement - transformational. If AI search delivers what it promises - relevant results, quality filtering, expert matching - we should see WAU increase from 43% to 60%+ within a year. That's the bar. Anything less means we've failed again."

**Q: What about adoption challenges?**

Richard: "We have a credibility problem. Consultants have tried AKX, it's failed them, they've given up. Getting them to try again requires marketing, training, executive sponsorship - the whole change management apparatus. And it requires the product to actually work this time. If we launch AI search and it's mediocre, we've spent our credibility. We don't get another chance."

**Q: How do you think about ROI for these investments?**

Richard: "Every hour a consultant saves searching for content is an hour they can bill to a client. If we save 4 hours per week per consultant who uses AKX, and we have 300,000 weekly users, that's 1.2 million hours per week. At average billing rates, that's enormous value. Plus the qualitative benefits: better proposals win more deals, faster expert mobilization wins competitive situations, happier consultants means lower attrition."

**Q: What keeps you up at night about this initiative?**

Richard: "Two things. First, execution. We've launched 'improved search' before. It didn't work. The team needs to actually deliver this time. Second, adoption. We can build great features, but if consultants don't use them, it doesn't matter. Change management is as important as product development. They need to work in parallel."

**Q: What do you need from the product team?**

Richard: "Transparency and accountability. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear. Tell me the truth - what's working, what's not, what you need. I can help remove obstacles, secure resources, get executive air cover. But only if I know what's really happening. And I need measurable progress. Monthly WAU numbers. Search satisfaction scores. Time-to-expert metrics. Show me the data."

**Q: What's the competitive pressure like?**

Richard: "Real. McKinsey's knowledge center is legendary. BCG is investing heavily in AI-powered tools. Even Deloitte is modernizing. Our consultants compare us to competitors constantly. 'At McKinsey, I could find anything.' I hear that all the time. We have scale advantages - more content, more experts, more reach. But scale is only an advantage if we can leverage it. Right now, scale is a liability because we can't navigate it."

**Q: Final message for the team?**

Richard: "This matters. Not just for metrics, but for our people. Consultants are frustrated. They want tools that work. They want to find expertise, not recreate wheels. If we fix this, we make their lives better, we make the company more competitive, we reduce waste. It's rare that a product investment has this much potential impact. Don't waste the opportunity."

## Key Insights
- Vision: Any employee finds any expert or knowledge asset in under 5 minutes (currently hours/days)
- Quantified cost: $200M+ per year in duplicated effort, plus lost deals
- Root cause: Underinvestment in core search functionality over years of edge improvements
- AI search bar: Must be transformational, not incremental - 43% to 60%+ WAU
- Credibility problem: Past failures mean consultants have given up on AKX
- ROI math: 4 hours/week saved × 300K users = 1.2M hours/week saved
- Two risks: Execution (actually delivering) and adoption (getting people to use it)
- Needs from team: Transparency, accountability, measurable progress with real data
- Competitive pressure: McKinsey, BCG, even Deloitte ahead or investing heavily
- Scale is currently liability (can't navigate) - should be advantage
- Stakes: "Don't waste the opportunity" - rare high-impact initiative
