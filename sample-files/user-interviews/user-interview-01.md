## Interview

**Q: Walk me through a typical day when you need to use AKX.**

Priya: "Honestly? I try to avoid it. Yesterday's a perfect example. Client calls at 9am, asks if we have blockchain expertise for their digital assets program. I have maybe 15 minutes before my next meeting. I go to AKX, type 'blockchain financial services,' get 500 results. Most are from 2019. I can't tell who's actually good. I give up after 5 minutes and send a mass email to my network. Three hours later, someone responds with a name. BCG would have had this in 30 minutes."

**Q: What happened with that deal specifically?**

Priya: "We lost it. Client wanted to see the team in two days. It took us four days to identify and mobilize someone. BCG showed up with their person in 48 hours. Done. We didn't even get a second chance. That's a $20 million engagement we lost because I couldn't find an expert fast enough."

**Q: How often does this happen?**

Priya: "Every week. Maybe not $20 million deals, but the pattern is constant. I need an expert in autonomous vehicles for a banking client exploring mobility partnerships. Someone with supply chain AI experience for trade finance. Cloud migration expertise in capital markets. Every time it's the same story - search AKX, get overwhelmed, give up, email my network."

**Q: What would success look like for you?**

Priya: "I want to search for 'blockchain capital markets 5+ years' and get back 10 names. Real experts, not everyone who once attended a blockchain webinar. With their actual availability - 'this person is free starting March 15.' With a way to contact them or their career counselor immediately. That's it. That's all I need. Five minutes from search to action."

**Q: Tell me about the expert profiles you do find.**

Priya: "Half the time they're wrong. Someone's profile says they have AWS experience from a project 3 years ago. But that project was a tiny piece, they weren't the lead, and they've done nothing with AWS since. The data isn't trustworthy. So even when I find someone, I have to verify by calling around. Which defeats the purpose."

**Q: What about reusing past work - proposals, presentations?**

Priya: "Same problem. I know we've done a cloud migration proposal for a regional bank before. I've seen it in someone's slide deck. But can I find it in AKX? No. I search, I get 200 results, none of them are it. My team ends up rebuilding from scratch. We probably recreate the same proposal outline 50 times a year across the practice."

**Q: How do McKinsey alumni on your team describe their experience?**

Priya: "They tell me McKinsey's knowledge center is light years ahead. You search, you find things. There are actual knowledge managers who curate content. Experts are tagged accurately because there's a process for it. It's not a dumping ground. One of my senior managers jokes that she found better content at McKinsey as a consultant than she can find here as an MD."

**Q: What would make you actively promote AKX to your practice?**

Priya: "Results. If AI search actually works - if I can find what I need in 5 minutes instead of 50 - I'll mandate it for my entire practice. I'll do a video testimonial. I'll make it part of our onboarding. But right now, recommending AKX would hurt my credibility. People try it, it fails them, they blame me for suggesting it."

**Q: Anything else we should know?**

Priya: "Mobile is terrible. I'm in cars, airports, between meetings. I need to do a quick search on my phone. Current AKX on mobile takes 15 seconds to load, if it loads at all. That's eternity when a client is asking me a question and I need to look something up. Fix the mobile experience. Make it fast."

## Key Insights
- Competitive losses directly attributed to slow expert discovery (BCG 48hrs vs. Accenture 4 days)
- Search returns too many irrelevant results - 500 results, most outdated
- Expert profile data is inaccurate and not trustworthy
- Content reuse is nearly impossible - teams recreate work constantly
- McKinsey alumni benchmark against superior internal tools
- Mobile performance is a blocker for partner adoption
- Would actively champion AKX if it demonstrably worked
- Time constraint is critical - needs answers in 5 minutes, not 50
