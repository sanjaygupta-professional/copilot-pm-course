## Interview

**Q: Tell me about your typical workday and where AKX fits in.**

Marcus: "So yesterday I needed to create a competitive landscape analysis for our retail client. I know someone has done this before - retail competitive analysis with focus on digital capabilities. I search AKX, I get like 300 documents. I spend 45 minutes going through results. Most are outdated, from 2020 or earlier. Some are just meeting notes that happen to mention 'retail' and 'competitive.' Eventually I find one decent framework from 2022, but the data is stale. I end up building my analysis from scratch anyway. Total waste of time."

**Q: How often does this pattern repeat?**

Marcus: "Daily. I'm not exaggerating. Every single day I need something - a framework, a template, an analysis someone's done before. And every single day I either can't find it or what I find is garbage. I've started just assuming I'll have to build everything myself. Which is demoralizing because I know this content exists somewhere."

**Q: What specifically is wrong with the search results?**

Marcus: "Three things. First, relevance - I search for 'AI strategy retail,' I get documents about retail that mention AI once in passing. Not AI strategy documents. Second, quality - there's no indicator of whether a document is good or junk. A random meeting note shows up next to a client-ready deliverable. Third, freshness - so much content is years old. In tech strategy, something from 2020 is ancient history."

**Q: You mentioned building your promotion case. How does AKX factor in?**

Marcus: "It doesn't, really. I'm supposed to document my thought leadership contributions. But there's no good way to track what I've contributed to AKX, how it's been used, whether it's helped anyone. I upload deliverables but they disappear into the void. I have no idea if they're being used or if they're helping anyone. It would be great to see 'Your AI strategy framework was used by 50 people this month.' That would actually motivate me to contribute more."

**Q: Tell me about finding experts or mentors in your area of interest.**

Marcus: "I want to build AI expertise. I search for AI experts in AKX, I get a list of names, but I have no idea who's actually good. Are they real experts or did they just take a certification? What projects have they worked on? Are they willing to mentor? The profiles are so basic. And there's no way to connect - I just get an email address. No context on mutual connections, no easy way to reach out. I end up asking my career counselor to make introductions, which is slow."

**Q: How does AKX compare to tools you've used before or elsewhere?**

Marcus: "I came from BCG two years ago. Their tools were modern - fast search, good results, AI-powered suggestions. It felt like using a consumer app. AKX feels like it was built in 2010. The UI is clunky, the search is slow, the mobile app barely works. I actually use Google to search for things faster sometimes, which is ridiculous for internal content."

**Q: What about the templates and frameworks - are those useful?**

Marcus: "When I can find them, yes. But the organization is terrible. There's no clear library of 'approved frameworks.' It's all mixed together with random documents. I've bookmarked maybe 20 good templates over the years. I share them with new team members because they'd never find them on their own. We essentially have a shadow system of sharing good content via email because AKX doesn't surface it properly."

**Q: What would your ideal experience look like?**

Marcus: "I search for 'AI strategy retail,' I get the 5 best documents. They're recent, they're high quality, they're actually about AI strategy. I can preview them without downloading. I can see who created them, maybe even reach out with questions. The whole thing takes 2 minutes, not 45. And when I contribute something good, I get recognition - it helps my promotion case, people can find it and use it."

**Q: Anything else?**

Marcus: "The tools at Accenture feel 10 years behind what I use in my personal life. Spotify knows exactly what music I want. Netflix recommends shows perfectly. Why can't AKX recommend content based on my project, my interests, my career goals? It has all that data. Use it."
