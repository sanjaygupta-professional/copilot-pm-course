## Interview

**Q: How does ADH fit into your daily work?**

Kevin: "Every day I'm supposed to update project status in ADH. Budget burn rate, milestone progress, risks, team utilization. In theory it's supposed to take 15 minutes. In practice, it takes me an hour because the interface is clunky, data entry is painful, and I'm duplicating information I've already captured elsewhere."

**Q: Tell me about the status reporting challenge.**

Kevin: "I have multiple stakeholders who want status updates. The client wants a weekly status call with slides. The delivery manager wants a different format. The practice lead wants high-level metrics. Finance wants project financial updates. I'm basically creating the same content four different ways. ADH should be generating these reports for me, but it doesn't."

**Q: What about the project health indicators in ADH?**

Kevin: "They're useless. The system shows 'green' if I mark it green. It doesn't actually assess project health. If I'm burning budget 20% faster than planned, the system doesn't know or care. I have to manually calculate that and update the status. What I want is: ADH looks at hours logged, budget consumed, milestones completed, and tells me 'Hey, you're trending toward a 15% overrun.' Automatically."

**Q: How do you handle resource requests?**

Kevin: "Right now it's email and spreadsheets. I need a data engineer starting April 1. I submit a request, it goes into a queue, someone manually reviews it, looks for available people. Takes days, sometimes weeks. By the time I get someone, my timeline has slipped. I've started requesting resources earlier than I need them, just to buffer the slow process."

**Q: What about when you need to find experts for a specific technical challenge?**

Kevin: "That's where AKX comes in, theoretically. I search for 'Azure Kubernetes migration' experts, I get a list. But I don't know who's good. I usually end up asking my delivery manager or posting in Teams channels. The expert search in AKX is a starting point but not the answer."

**Q: Tell me about team utilization tracking.**

Kevin: "My team is supposed to log time in ADH. Some do it daily, some do it weekly, some forget until someone reminds them. The mobile time entry is terrible, so people avoid it. The data ends up being 2-3 weeks stale. When Elena asks me about team utilization, I have to chase people down to update their timesheets before I can answer accurately."

**Q: What would make your job easier?**

Kevin: "Three things. First, automated status reports - pull data from the system and generate a report I can customize. Second, real health indicators that actually look at data and tell me when something's wrong. Third, faster resource allocation - I should be able to see who's available and request them in minutes, not days."

**Q: How does this compare to tools at other firms?**

Kevin: "I hear mixed things. Friends at Deloitte complain too, but they say things are improving. BCG apparently has better tools, at least that's what consultants who've worked there tell me. McKinsey is supposed to be gold standard but they're smaller, so maybe it's just easier. At our scale, everything is harder."

**Q: Any final thoughts?**

Kevin: "The fundamental problem is that ADH feels like it was designed for finance and HR, not for project managers. The interface, the workflows, the reports - they're not oriented toward how I actually manage a project. It's like someone built a system and then said 'PMs can use it too.' We need tools built for us."

## Key Insights
- Status reporting is duplicative - same content reformatted for different stakeholders
- Project health indicators are manual, not automated based on actual data
- Resource requests take days/weeks - started requesting early as a buffer
- Time entry is stale due to poor mobile experience and consultant compliance
- Expert search in AKX is a starting point but doesn't provide quality signals
- Wants automated health alerts based on budget burn, milestone tracking
- ADH designed for finance/HR, not project managers - workflow mismatch
- Status update that should take 15 minutes takes an hour
- Would benefit from auto-generated reports with customization options
- Competitive comparison suggests firms are all struggling, but some improving
