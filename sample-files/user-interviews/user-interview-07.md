## Interview

**Q: How does ADH fit into your daily work?**

Robert: "ADH is supposed to be my source of truth for everything - who's staffed where, who's available, what the utilization picture looks like. In reality, I spend half my day chasing data that should be in ADH but isn't, or correcting data that's wrong."

**Q: What's the utilization visibility challenge?**

Robert: "We're supposed to be at 85% utilization. To know where we actually are, I need accurate data on who's staffed and for how many hours. ADH says we're at 82%. But I know that's wrong because half the data is stale. Some consultants haven't logged time in two weeks. Some project assignments aren't updated. When I manually audit a sample, actual utilization is somewhere between 78% and 86%. That's a huge range when every percentage point is millions of dollars."

**Q: Tell me about resource allocation at the practice level.**

Robert: "Partners need people for their projects. Consultants need projects to stay busy. My job is matching supply and demand. In theory, ADH helps me see who's available. In practice, the availability data is 2-4 weeks stale. So I'm making staffing decisions based on outdated information. Someone shows as 'available' but they got staffed last week. Someone shows as 'on project' but they're rolling off in two days."

**Q: What about forecasting?**

Robert: "Forecasting is a nightmare. I need to predict: In 90 days, how many consultants will be available? What skills will we have? What skills will we need? I build this manually in Excel, pulling data from multiple sources, making assumptions, updating weekly. It takes hours. And the forecast is probably 65% accurate. Which means we're constantly surprised by gaps or oversupply."

**Q: How do you handle bench management?**

Robert: "Bench is expensive - consultants not billable but still on payroll. I need to know who's on bench, for how long, what skills they have. ADH gives me a list, but it's not real-time. Someone might be on bench in ADH but already tentatively assigned to a project. Someone might show as staffed but their project got canceled yesterday. I have to verify every piece of data."

**Q: What reporting do you provide to leadership?**

Robert: "Weekly utilization report, monthly capacity forecast, quarterly skills gap analysis. Creating these reports takes me 4-5 hours per week. I'm pulling data from ADH, cleaning it, formatting it, adding commentary. The same basic report every week, manually assembled. Should be automated."

**Q: What would transform how you work?**

Robert: "Real-time data. If ADH actually had current information - who's staffed where, who's available, what skills people have - my job would be different. I could spend time on analysis and strategy instead of data chasing and verification. Give me a dashboard that I can trust on Monday morning, and I'm 10x more effective."

**Q: How does this compare to what you've heard about competitors?**

Robert: "McKinsey apparently has better staffing systems. BCG is investing heavily in their resource management. We have the scale that makes this hard - 700,000 people is a different challenge than 50,000. But that's also an excuse. We have the data, we just don't use it well. Other firms with similar scale, like Deloitte, seem to be making more progress."

**Q: Final thoughts?**

Robert: "The irony is that we sell operational excellence to clients. Efficiency, optimization, data-driven decision making. And our own internal operations run on spreadsheets and tribal knowledge. If a client saw how we manage our own utilization, they'd laugh. We need to eat our own cooking."
