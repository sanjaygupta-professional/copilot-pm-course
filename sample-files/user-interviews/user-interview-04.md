## Interview

**Q: Tell me about your first experience with AKX.**

Aisha: "Honestly? Overwhelming. During onboarding they showed us this tool, said 'all our knowledge is here,' and then moved on. My first week on a project, my manager asked me to find a healthcare market sizing framework. I went to AKX, typed it in, got hundreds of results. I had no idea which one to use. Are they all good? Are some outdated? I spent two hours and eventually just asked a colleague who emailed me their favorite template."

**Q: How do you use AKX now, 8 months in?**

Aisha: "I mostly don't. I've learned it's faster to ask someone than to search. My team has a shared folder with 'the good stuff' - templates, frameworks, examples they've collected over time. That's my go-to. AKX is sort of a last resort when no one knows what I need."

**Q: What would help you use AKX more effectively?**

Aisha: "Curation. Tell me what's good. When I search for something, show me 'Top 5 recommended' or 'Most used this year.' Have someone - maybe the practice - tag content as 'approved' or 'gold standard.' Right now everything looks the same. A random meeting note and a polished client deliverable both show up as search results. I can't tell the difference."

**Q: How about finding experts or mentors?**

Aisha: "I tried once. I wanted to find someone in healthcare AI because I'm interested in that area. I searched in AKX, found some names, but I had no idea who was approachable or who might be willing to mentor a junior person. I was too intimidated to cold-email a Managing Director. If there was something like 'open to mentoring' or 'available for coffee chats,' that would help."

**Q: What's your experience with ADH?**

Aisha: "I use it for timesheets. That's literally it. I enter my hours, submit my expenses. The interface is not intuitive - took me weeks to figure out where things were. I've heard ADH has information about projects and staffing but I've never explored it. No one showed me how."

**Q: How was the overall onboarding experience with these tools?**

Aisha: "There was a lot thrown at us during onboarding - too much to absorb. For the tools, it was basically 'here's what it is, here's how to log in.' No hands-on practice, no real use cases. By the time I actually needed to use AKX for a project, I'd forgotten everything from onboarding. Trial and error is how I've learned."

**Q: What do you think would help new hires?**

Aisha: "Real examples. Show me: 'You're an analyst, here are the 5 things you'll search for most often, here's how to find them.' Make it role-specific. And have some kind of 'starter kit' - pre-bookmarked content for new analysts, recommended templates, key documents. Don't throw me into a system with millions of documents and expect me to figure it out."

**Q: Anything else you'd like us to know?**

Aisha: "My peers and I talk about this. We all have the same experience - AKX is overwhelming, ADH is confusing. We've all developed workarounds. Maybe that's normal? But it feels like we're working around tools instead of with them. And when I compare to friends at other consulting firms, they seem to have an easier time with their internal systems."
