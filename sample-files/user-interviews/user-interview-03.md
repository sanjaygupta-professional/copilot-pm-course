## Interview

**Q: Walk me through how you start your typical week.**

Elena: "Monday morning, I need to know: Are my projects on track? Are there risks I need to escalate? Do I have resource gaps coming? Right now, that takes me about 3 hours. I log into ADH, but the data is often stale. PMs are supposed to update project status, but half of them don't. So I'm messaging each PM: 'Is Project X really on track?' Meanwhile, I have a status meeting with leadership at 10am and I'm scrambling to compile something trustworthy."

**Q: What would you expect from ADH that you're not getting?**

Elena: "Real-time project health. Not what the PM says the status is, but what the data says. If a project is burning budget faster than planned, I want to see that. If hours are tracking higher than estimated, flag it. If milestones are slipping, show me automatically. I shouldn't have to ask - the system should tell me."

**Q: Tell me about resource management challenges.**

Elena: "It's a nightmare. Right now I have two projects that need a Salesforce architect starting next month. I search ADH for available Salesforce architects, I get a list, but the availability data is weeks old. So I start calling around - is this person actually available? Oh, they got staffed on something else last week. The data wasn't updated. By the time I find someone, the project is delayed."

**Q: How much time do you spend on status reporting?**

Elena: "Too much. At least 4 hours a week. I have different templates for different stakeholders. The practice lead wants one view, the client wants another, finance wants project financial status. I'm basically copying and pasting data between systems, reformatting it, adding commentary. Friday afternoon is just status report preparation. It should be automated."

**Q: What about forecasting and capacity planning?**

Elena: "Terrible. I need to know: In 60 days, how many consultants will be rolling off projects? What skills do I need for the pipeline? Right now, I'm building spreadsheets manually. I pull data from ADH, adjust for what I know that isn't in the system, make educated guesses. The forecast is probably 65% accurate at best. Which means we're constantly surprised by gaps."

**Q: How do you use AKX in your role?**

Elena: "Occasionally. When I'm onboarding a new project manager, I look for project plan templates, lessons learned from similar projects. The search is hit or miss - sometimes I find good stuff, sometimes I waste an hour finding nothing. For project templates specifically, I've saved a few good ones locally. Faster than searching every time."

**Q: What would ideal tools look like for you?**

Elena: "A dashboard I can glance at Monday morning and immediately know: These 2 projects need attention, these 6 are fine. Here are your resource gaps for the next 90 days. Here's your status report for the practice lead, auto-generated with real data. I want to spend time managing delivery, not managing data. The system should do the data work."

**Q: How do you handle project risks currently?**

Elena: "Project managers are supposed to log risks in ADH, but they don't consistently. Or they log them but don't escalate. So I find out about issues in status meetings, which is too late. I want the system to identify risks automatically - 'Hey, this project just exceeded 90% of budget with 50% of work remaining, you should look at it.' Don't wait for a human to flag it."

**Q: How does this compare to tools you've used before?**

Elena: "I worked at Deloitte for two years early in my career. Their tools weren't perfect, but I hear they've invested heavily recently. My peers there talk about real-time dashboards, predictive staffing. We're behind. And it's frustrating because we have the data - it's just not surfaced in a useful way."

**Q: Anything else we should know?**

Elena: "Time entry is a pain point for my consultants. They complain about it constantly. The mobile experience is clunky. If we made time entry easier, we'd get better data, which would make everything else more accurate. It's a virtuous cycle that we're not capturing."

## Key Insights
- Spends 3+ hours Monday morning compiling project status manually - data in ADH is stale
- Wants automated health indicators based on actual data, not PM self-reports
- Resource availability data is weeks old - leads to double-booking and delays
- Status reporting takes 4+ hours per week - different formats for different stakeholders
- Forecasting is only 65% accurate due to manual processes and stale data
- Risks aren't logged consistently - discovers issues too late
- Wants predictive alerts: budget burns, milestone slips, resource gaps
- Deloitte peer comparison suggests competitors are investing heavily
- Time entry friction causes data quality problems downstream
- Saves templates locally because search is unreliable
