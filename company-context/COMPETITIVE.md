## Why Internal Products Matter Competitively

### The Consulting Talent War

Consulting firms compete primarily on two dimensions:

2. **Talent** - Can we attract, develop, and retain the best people?

Internal products directly impact both:
- **Expert discovery** helps win pitches (find the right people fast)
- **Knowledge management** improves delivery (don't reinvent the wheel)
- **Modern tools** attract talent (millennials expect consumer-grade apps)
- **Efficient operations** improve margins (reduce administrative waste)

| **Fast expert discovery** | High - staff proposals quickly | Medium - find SMEs for projects | Low |
| **Reusable content** | High - proposal efficiency | High - delivery speed | Medium - less tedious work |
| **Utilization visibility** | Medium - resource planning | High - project health | Medium - fair workload |
