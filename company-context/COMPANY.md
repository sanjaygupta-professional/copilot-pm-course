- "Bench" (available consultants) not utilized efficiently
- Resource allocation is manual, spreadsheet-based
- Forecasting relies on stale data

**4. Adoption of Internal Tools**

- Low adoption despite significant investment
- Consultants prefer familiar consumer tools (Google, Notion)
- Training doesn't translate to daily usage
