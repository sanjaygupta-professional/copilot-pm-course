# Accenture Internal Products Overview

**Your complete guide to AKX and ADH**

---

## Overview

You own two internal products that serve Accenture's 700,000+ employees:

1. **Accenture Knowledge Exchange (AKX)** - Knowledge management and expert discovery
2. **Accenture Delivery Hub (ADH)** - Project delivery and resource management

These products are critical infrastructure for how Accenture operates. Unlike external B2B products, your "customers" are employees, adoption is influenced by mandates and culture, and success is measured by enterprise-wide efficiency rather than revenue.
