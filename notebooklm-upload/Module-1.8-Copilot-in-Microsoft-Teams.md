## Teams Copilot Best Practices

### Do:
- ✅ Enable meeting transcription for all important meetings
- ✅ Use Copilot immediately after meetings for follow-ups
- ✅ Ask specific questions (not just "summarize")

- ✅ Use channel summaries for daily catch-up

### Don't:
- ❌ Rely solely on Copilot for critical decisions
- ❌ Skip meetings assuming Copilot will cover it
- ❌ Share Copilot summaries without review
- ❌ Forget that transcription must be enabled
- ❌ Ignore context Copilot might miss
