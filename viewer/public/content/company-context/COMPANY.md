## Product Philosophy

### Core Beliefs

**1. Context over status updates**
- Tasks should have enough context that anyone can pick them up
- Status meetings are waste - status should be visible in the tool

**2. Async by default**
- Don't require synchronous coordination
- Build for teams across timezones

**3. Opinionated but flexible**
- Strong defaults (workflows that work)
- Customizable when needed (not overwhelming)

**4. Speed matters**
- Tools should be fast to learn, fast to use, fast to load
- No loading spinners, no lag

**5. Beautiful and functional**
- Good design isn't just aesthetics
- UI should guide users to success
