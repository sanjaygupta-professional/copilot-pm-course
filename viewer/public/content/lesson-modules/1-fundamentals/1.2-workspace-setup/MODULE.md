## Exercise 1: Upload Your First File

Let's practice uploading a file to Copilot.

**Do this now:**

1. Download this sample meeting notes file (or create a simple text file with meeting notes)
2. Open Copilot Chat at copilot.microsoft.com
3. Click the 📎 attachment icon
4. Select your file
5. Once uploaded, type this prompt:

```
Please analyze this meeting notes file and:
1. Extract all action items
2. Identify who is responsible for each
3. Note any decisions that were made
4. Flag any items that need follow-up
```

6. Review Copilot's analysis

**What you should notice:**

## ContextIQ: Adding Content to Prompts

ContextIQ is a powerful feature that lets you add context from your work environment.

### How to Use ContextIQ

1. In Copilot Chat, type `/` (forward slash)
2. A menu appears with options:
   - **Files** - Browse OneDrive files
   - **People** - Reference colleagues
   - **Meetings** - Access meeting transcripts
   - **Emails** - Reference recent emails

3. Select what you want to add
4. It becomes part of your prompt context

### Example: Reference Multiple Sources

```
Based on /[meeting transcript from yesterday] and /[Q4 planning doc],
summarize the key priorities for our team this quarter.
```

---

## Exercise 2: Use ContextIQ

Let's try using ContextIQ to reference your work content.

**Do this now:**

1. In Copilot Chat, type: `/`
2. Select "Files" from the menu
3. Browse to any document in your OneDrive
4. Select it to add as context
5. Now type a prompt like:

```
Summarize the key points from this document in 3 bullet points.
```

**Note:** If you don't have files in OneDrive yet, you can upload the sample files from this course first.

---

## OneDrive Integration

When you use Copilot, your files are automatically connected to OneDrive.

### What This Means

1. **Uploaded files are saved** - Files you upload go to "Microsoft Copilot Chat Files" folder in OneDrive
2. **You can re-access them** - Find previous uploads in OneDrive
3. **Enterprise security** - Your data stays within your tenant
4. **Not used for training** - Microsoft doesn't train models on your data

### Setting Up Your Course Files

For this course, we recommend creating a folder structure:

```
OneDrive/
├── Copilot-Course/
│   ├── TaskFlow-Context/
│   │   ├── COMPANY.md
│   │   ├── PRODUCT.md
│   │   └── PERSONAS.md
│   ├── Meeting-Notes/
│   ├── User-Interviews/
│   └── Data-Files/
```

**Action:** Create this folder structure in your OneDrive and upload the course sample files.

4. The Copilot panel opens on the right
5. Type this prompt:

```
Write a brief executive summary for a product called TaskFlow -
a project management tool for remote teams. Include: what it does,
who it's for, and key differentiators. Keep it to 3 paragraphs.
```

6. Copilot generates content directly in your document!

**What you should notice:**
