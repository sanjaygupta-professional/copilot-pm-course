## Introduction

Welcome to the Microsoft Copilot PM Course!

You're about to learn how to use Microsoft Copilot - an AI assistant that can save you **10-20 hours per week** as a Product Manager. Unlike traditional tools, Copilot integrates directly into the Microsoft 365 apps you already use: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams.

Throughout this course, you'll work for a fictional company called **TaskFlow** - imagine Asana meets Jira, but built specifically for remote teams. It's a project management SaaS that's growing fast.

**What makes this course different:** All the files, documents, and context are already created for you. You're stepping into a real (fictional) PM role with active projects, real user personas, and actual work to do!
