Analyze these user interview transcripts. I'm looking for patterns.

Please identify:
1. **Common Pain Points** - Issues mentioned by 2+ users
2. **Feature Requests** - Specific features users asked for
3. **Positive Feedback** - What users love about the product
4. **Surprising Insights** - Anything unexpected
5. **Quotes** - Compelling quotes for each key finding

For each finding, note which interviews mentioned it.
Rank pain points by frequency (most common first).
