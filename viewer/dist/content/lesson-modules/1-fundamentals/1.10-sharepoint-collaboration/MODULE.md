## Why SharePoint + Copilot Matters for PMs

PMs often need to find information scattered across the organization:

| Challenge | Without Copilot | With Copilot |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Finding a past PRD | Browse folders, search keywords | "Find the Q3 mobile app PRD" |
| Understanding a new team's work | Read through site, open docs | "Summarize what this team does" |
| Checking document updates | Open each file, check history | "What changed this week?" |
| Cross-referencing content | Multiple tabs, manual reading | "Compare these two documents" |

**Time savings: ~2 hours/week** on document discovery and information gathering.

---

## Section 1: Document Discovery

Copilot helps you find documents using natural language instead of keyword searches.

### Accessing Copilot for SharePoint

1. Go to **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat** (copilot.microsoft.com)
2. Or use **Copilot in M365 apps** with SharePoint context
3. Your work content (including SharePoint) is searchable

### Finding Documents

**Basic document search:**
```
Find the product roadmap document from Q4 2025
```

**More specific:**
```
Find PRDs related to the onboarding project in the Product team's SharePoint
```

**By author or date:**
```
Find documents that Sarah created about user research in the last month
```

**By content:**
```
Find documents that mention "activation rate" or "onboarding funnel"
```

---

## Exercise 1: Find a Document

**Do this now:**

1. Open Copilot Chat (copilot.microsoft.com)
2. Try finding a document you know exists:

```
Find the most recent product roadmap document in our SharePoint
```

```
Find documents about [your current project] created in the last 3 months
```

```
Find the competitive analysis document for [competitor name]
```

**What to notice:**
- Copilot searches across SharePoint sites you have access to
- Results include file names and locations
- You can ask follow-up questions about what it finds

## Asking About Documents Without Opening Them

One of the most powerful features: get answers from documents without reading them.

### Prompts for Document Questions

**Summarize a document:**
```
Summarize the key points from the Q4 product roadmap document
```

**Ask specific questions:**
```
What does the mobile app PRD say about the target launch date?
```

**Extract information:**
```
What are the success metrics defined in the activation project brief?
```

**Compare documents:**
```
What are the differences between the Q3 and Q4 roadmap documents?
```

---

## Exercise 2: Ask About a Document

**Do this now:**

1. Think of a document you need information from
2. Ask Copilot without opening it:

```
What are the main goals outlined in [document name]?
```

```
Summarize the decisions made in [meeting notes document]
```

```
What action items are listed in [project document]?
```

---

## Section 2: Site & Library Intelligence

Copilot can summarize entire SharePoint sites and document libraries.

### Summarizing a SharePoint Site

**Understand a new team's site:**
```
Summarize what the Engineering team's SharePoint site contains
```

**Find what's relevant:**
```
What content on the Product team site is relevant to onboarding?
```

**Identify key resources:**
```
What are the most important documents in the Design team's site?
```

### Document Library Intelligence

**Understand a library:**
```
What types of documents are in the PRD library?
```

**Find recent content:**
```
What documents were added to the Product team site this week?
```

**Identify patterns:**
```
What topics are most covered in the Research folder?
```

---

## Exercise 3: Explore a SharePoint Site

**Do this now:**

1. Choose a SharePoint site you have access to
2. Ask Copilot:

```
Summarize what the [Team Name] SharePoint site is for and 
what key documents it contains
```

```
What are the most recently updated documents on [site name]?
```

```
What content on [site name] would be useful for a PM working 
on activation and onboarding?
```

---

## Section 3: Collaborative Workflows

Integrate SharePoint content into your daily PM workflows.

### Combining SharePoint with Other Sources

**Research across sources:**
```
Based on the PRD in SharePoint and recent emails about the project,
summarize the current status of the mobile app initiative
```

**Prepare for meetings:**
```
Find all documents related to tomorrow's roadmap review meeting
and summarize the key discussion points
```

**Create new content from existing:**
```
Based on the user research documents in SharePoint, 
draft a summary of the top 3 user pain points
```

### Recent Updates and Changes

**Stay current:**
```
What documents in the Product team site have been updated 
in the last week?
```

**Track project changes:**
```
What changes were made to the onboarding PRD recently?
```

**Monitor team activity:**
```
What new documents have been added to the Q1 Planning folder?
```

---

## Exercise 4: Integrated Workflow

**Do this now:**

Try a workflow that combines SharePoint with other sources:

```
Find all documents related to [your current project] and create 
a summary of:
1. Current project status
2. Key decisions made
3. Open questions or blockers
4. Next steps
```

Or for meeting prep:

```
I have a meeting about [topic] tomorrow. Find relevant documents 
from SharePoint and summarize what I should know going in.
```

## SharePoint Copilot Best Practices

### Do:
- ✅ Use natural language, not keywords
- ✅ Be specific about what you're looking for
- ✅ Ask about documents without opening them first
- ✅ Combine SharePoint search with other M365 sources
- ✅ Use Copilot to stay updated on changes

### Don't:
- ❌ Expect access to sites you don't have permission for
- ❌ Rely on Copilot for confidential document security
- ❌ Assume all content is indexed (new content takes time)
- ❌ Skip verifying important information
- ❌ Forget that Copilot only sees what you can see

## Prompt Templates for SharePoint

Save these for quick use:

### Document Discovery
```
Find documents about [topic] in [location/team site]
that were created in [timeframe]
```

### Document Summary
```
Summarize [document name] including:
1. Main purpose
2. Key points
3. Decisions or recommendations
4. Action items
```

### Site Overview
```
Give me an overview of the [Team] SharePoint site:
1. What is it for?
2. Key document types
3. Most important resources
4. Recent activity
```

### Project Research
```
Find all SharePoint documents related to [project name] and:
1. List the key documents
2. Summarize the project status
3. Identify any gaps in documentation
```

## Combining the Collaboration Trilogy

You've now mastered Teams, Outlook, and SharePoint with Copilot. Here's how they work together:

| Need | Tool | Copilot Action |
|------|------|----------------|
| Real-time discussion | Teams | Meeting summaries, chat help |
| Async communication | Outlook | Email drafting, thread summaries |
| Document storage | SharePoint | Document discovery, site intelligence |

### Power Workflow Example

**Preparing for a product review:**

1. **SharePoint:** "Find all documents related to Q1 product review"
2. **Outlook:** "Summarize email threads about the Q1 review"
3. **Teams:** "What was discussed in the last product sync meeting?"
4. **Combine:** "Based on all of this, create an agenda for the review"
