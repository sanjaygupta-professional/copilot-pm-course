## Your First Image

### Basic Prompt Structure

```
Create an image of [SUBJECT] that is [STYLE], [MOOD], [ADDITIONAL DETAILS]
```

### Example

```
Create an image of a modern project management dashboard 
that is clean and minimal, professional, showing tasks 
organized in columns with a blue and white color scheme
```

### Exercise 1: Generate Your First Image

**Do this now:**

1. Open Copilot Chat
2. Enter this prompt:

```
Create an image of a diverse remote team collaborating on a 
video call, shown on a laptop screen. The style should be 
modern and professional, with a clean office background.
```

3. Wait for image generation
4. Review the result

**What to notice:**
- Image appears in the chat
- You can download it
- You can ask for variations

## Effective Image Prompts

### The SSMD Framework

**S** - Subject (What's in the image)
**S** - Style (Artistic style)
**M** - Mood (Feeling/atmosphere)
**D** - Details (Specific elements)

### Good vs. Bad Prompts

| Bad Prompt | Good Prompt |
|------------|-------------|
| "A dashboard" | "A clean, modern SaaS dashboard with task cards, a sidebar navigation, and a blue/white color scheme, flat design style" |
| "A person working" | "A product manager presenting to stakeholders in a modern conference room, professional and confident, photographically realistic" |
| "A flow chart" | "A simple user onboarding flow diagram with 5 steps, minimal style, using icons and arrows, on a white background" |

### Style Options

| Style | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Photorealistic** | Looks like a photo | Team photos, product shots |
| **Flat design** | Clean, minimal, 2D | UI mockups, icons |
| **Isometric** | 3D-like from an angle | Diagrams, infographics |
| **Illustration** | Hand-drawn style | Personas, stories |
| **Corporate** | Professional, stock-like | Presentations |

## Iterating on Images

Often the first image isn't perfect. Here's how to iterate:

### Request Variations

```
Generate 3 variations of this image with different color schemes
```

### Make Specific Changes

```
Regenerate this but:
- Make the background lighter
- Add more diversity to the team
- Make it feel more energetic
```

### Start Fresh with Refinements

```
Create a new image similar to the previous one but with [changes]
```

---

## Exercise 2: Image Iteration

Let's practice refining an image.

**Step 1: Generate base image**
```
Create an image of a mobile app onboarding screen showing a 
welcome message, in a modern flat design style with a gradient 
purple to blue background
```

**Step 2: Request changes**
```
This is good, but please:
- Add a friendly mascot character
- Include progress dots at the bottom
- Make the text placeholder visible
```

**Step 3: Create variations**
```
Generate 2 more variations: one with a green color scheme, 
one with an orange color scheme
```

## Prompting Best Practices

### Be Specific

```

   over 6 months, with blue bars on a white background, clean 
   and corporate style"

❌ "A chart"
```

### Describe Composition

```
✅ "A laptop on a desk, viewed from a 45-degree angle, 
   showing a dashboard on screen, with a coffee cup to 
   the right and a notepad to the left"

❌ "A laptop with dashboard"
```

### Specify Colors

```
✅ "Use TaskFlow's brand colors: primary blue (#2563EB), 
   accent purple (#7C3AED), on a white (#FFFFFF) background"

❌ "Make it look nice"
```

### Include Context

```
✅ "This is for a SaaS product called TaskFlow that helps 
   remote teams manage projects. The image will be used 
   in a pitch deck for investors."

❌ "Make a business image"
```
