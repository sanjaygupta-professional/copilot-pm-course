## Building a Visual Library

### Creating Consistency

For consistent visuals across your work:

1. **Define your style** - Pick one illustration style
2. **Lock in colors** - Use specific brand colors
3. **Save prompts** - Keep successful prompts for reuse
4. **Use templates** - Start with proven prompts

### Prompt Template Library

**For Personas:**
```
Create a professional illustration of [NAME]:
- [Gender], [age range], [ethnicity if relevant]
- [Role/job title]
- [Key personality traits]
- [Attire description]
- [Background setting]
- Illustration style: [your chosen style]
```

**For Flow Diagrams:**
```
Create a [type] diagram showing:
[Steps numbered and connected]
Style: [clean/minimal/detailed]
Shapes: [rectangles/circles/icons]
Colors: [color scheme]
Layout: [horizontal/vertical/grid]
```

**For Marketing:**
```
Create a [platform] graphic for [purpose]:
Visual elements: [list elements]
Text to include: [headlines/taglines]
Style: [marketing/corporate/casual]
Brand colors: [specific colors]
Mood: [emotion/feeling]
```

## Designer for Polish

Use Microsoft Designer for final touches:

### Common Enhancements

1. **Add accurate text** - Overlay text on images
2. **Insert logos** - Add your brand logo
3. **Create templates** - Build reusable designs
4. **Remove backgrounds** - Isolate subjects
5. **Add brand elements** - Consistent headers/footers

### Workflow: Copilot → Designer

1. Generate base image in Copilot
2. Download the image
3. Open in Designer
4. Add text, logos, enhancements
5. Export in needed format/size

---

## Credit-Efficient Workflow

With limited credits, be strategic:

### Before Generating

1. Write your prompt fully
2. Review for missing details
3. Reference successful past prompts
4. Be specific about style and colors

### Batch Similar Work

Generate all personas in one session:
- Similar prompts iterate better
- Consistent style across images
- Efficient use of your time

### Reuse and Adapt

- Save all generated images
- Many images work across contexts
- Minor edits in Designer vs. regenerating
