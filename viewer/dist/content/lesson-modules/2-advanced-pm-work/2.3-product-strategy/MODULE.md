## Strategy Frameworks with Copilot

Copilot can help you apply classic strategic frameworks faster.

### Framework 1: SWOT Analysis

```
Create a SWOT analysis for TaskFlow's position in the project 
management market.

Context:
- Series B startup, $2.5M ARR
- Competing with Asana, Jira, Linear, Monday.com
- Differentiation: Built for remote teams
- 10,000 active users

For each quadrant (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats):
- List 4-5 specific items
- Explain why each matters
- Suggest strategic implications

Format as a 2x2 matrix.
```

### Framework 2: Porter's Five Forces

```
Analyze the project management SaaS market using Porter's Five Forces.

For each force, rate it (High/Medium/Low) and explain:

1. **Threat of New Entrants**
2. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**
3. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**
4. **Threat of Substitutes**
5. **Competitive Rivalry**

Conclude with: What does this mean for TaskFlow's strategy?
```

### Framework 3: Jobs to Be Done

```
Apply the Jobs to Be Done framework to TaskFlow.

For each of our personas (Sarah, Mike, Alex), identify:

**Functional Job:** What task are they trying to accomplish?
**Emotional Job:** How do they want to feel?
**Social Job:** How do they want to be perceived?

Then identify:
- Which jobs are we doing well?
- Which jobs are underserved?
- Where's the biggest opportunity?
```

## Competitive Positioning

### Using Researcher for Competitive Intel

```
[Use Researcher Agent]

Create a competitive intelligence report on Linear.

Research:
1. Recent product launches (last 6 months)
2. Pricing changes
3. Target market shifts
4. User sentiment (reviews, social media)
5. Key differentiators vs. Jira/Asana
6. Funding and team growth

Include sources and create an executive summary.
```

### Positioning Analysis

```
Help me develop TaskFlow's competitive positioning.

Our competitors:
- Asana: Enterprise-focused, comprehensive but complex
- Jira: Developer-focused, powerful but overwhelming
- Linear: Fast, opinionated, loved by startups
- Monday.com: Flexible, visual, wide appeal

Our strengths:
- Built specifically for remote teams
- Real-time collaboration features
- Simpler than Jira, more powerful than Trello

Create:
1. **Positioning Statement** (classic format)
2. **Value Proposition Canvas**
3. **Key Differentiators** (top 3)
4. **Target Sweet Spot** (who we win with)
5. **Competitive Battlecards** (vs. each competitor)
```

---

## Roadmap Prioritization

### Framework: Impact vs. Effort Matrix

```
Help me prioritize these potential features for TaskFlow:

1. Mobile app
2. Slack integration  
3. Advanced reporting
4. AI task suggestions
5. Time tracking
6. Custom fields
7. Guest access
8. Workflow automation

For each, estimate:
- Impact on activation (High/Med/Low)
- Impact on retention (High/Med/Low)
- Engineering effort (S/M/L/XL)
- Alignment with "remote teams" positioning

Create a 2x2 matrix (Impact vs. Effort) and recommend:
- Quick wins (high impact, low effort)
- Big bets (high impact, high effort)
- Fill-ins (low impact, low effort)
- Avoid (low impact, high effort)
```

### Framework: RICE Scoring

```
Apply RICE scoring to these feature candidates:

Features:
1. Onboarding wizard redesign
2. Slack integration
3. Mobile app

For each, help me estimate:
- **Reach:** How many users per quarter?
- **Impact:** Effect on user (0.25/0.5/1/2/3)
- **Confidence:** How sure are we? (percentage)
- **Effort:** Person-weeks

Calculate RICE score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Rank and recommend which to prioritize.
```

## Exercise: Strategic Planning Session

Let's run a strategic planning session for TaskFlow Q2.

### Step 1: Situation Analysis (Researcher)

```
[Use Researcher Agent]

Research the current state of the project management tools market:
- Market size and growth trends
- Key trends shaping the industry
- Recent moves by major players
- What users are asking for (based on reviews/forums)

Create a "State of the Market" brief for Q2 planning.
```

### Step 2: Strategic Options

```
Based on TaskFlow's position (remote-first PM tool, Series B, 
$2.5M ARR, 10K users), generate 3 strategic options for Q2:

**Option A: Land and Expand**
Focus on growing within existing accounts

**Option B: Market Expansion**
Target new customer segments

**Option C: Product Deepening**
Build more features for current users

For each option:
- Key initiatives
- Resource requirements
- Expected outcomes
- Risks
- Success metrics
```

### Step 3: Decision Framework

```
Create a decision framework for choosing between these options.

Consider:
- Our Q2 constraints (runway, team size)
- Competitive dynamics
- User feedback themes
- Strategic fit with Series C positioning

Recommend an option with supporting reasoning.
```

## Stakeholder Communication

### Executive Summary

```
Transform this detailed strategy document into an executive summary
for our board meeting.

[Paste your strategy work]

Create:
1. **One-Sentence Strategy** (10 words or less)
2. **Key Bets** (3 bullet points)
3. **Success Metrics** (3-4 KPIs)
4. **Risks & Mitigations** (top 2)
5. **Resource Ask** (what we need)

Tone: Confident but realistic. Data-driven.
```

### Strategy Narrative

```
Help me create a strategy narrative for the all-hands meeting.

Our strategy: [Brief description]

Create a compelling narrative that:
1. Starts with the customer problem we're solving
2. Explains why now is the right time
3. Shows how our approach is different
4. Paints a picture of success
5. Clarifies what we're NOT doing
6. Ends with a clear call to action

Tone: Inspiring but grounded. 5-minute read.
```

## Devil's Advocate Analysis

A powerful technique: ask Copilot to challenge your strategy.

```
Play devil's advocate on this strategy:

[Your strategy summary]

As a skeptical board member:
1. What are the 3 biggest holes in this strategy?
2. What assumptions are we making that could be wrong?
3. What would competitors do to counter this?
4. Why might this fail?
5. What's the "pre-mortem" - if we failed in 12 months, why?

Be tough but constructive. I want to stress-test this.
```
